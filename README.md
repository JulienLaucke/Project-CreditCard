# Loan Approval System

This is a loan approval system that uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of a loan application being approved. The system is built with Python and Streamlit and uses an XGBoost model for predictions.

## Overview

The system allows users to input various details through the sidebar and check the loan approval status. Additionally, it provides useful visualizations to understand which features are important for loan approval.

## Features

- Input applicant details through the sidebar.
- Predict loan approval status based on the entered details.
- Various visualizations to analyze the data and features.

## Data

The dataset used is a sample dataset containing information about loan applications. The data has been preprocessed to remove missing values and encode categorical variables.

## Model

The model is trained using XGBoost and integrated into a pipeline with StandardScaler for scaling the data. Feature importance is also displayed to identify the most significant features for loan decisions.

## Usage


Enter the required information in the sidebar.
Click on "Check Loan Approval" to get the prediction.
Select various visualizations from the sidebar to analyze the data.


## Visualizations


The system offers several visualizations, including:

- Distribution of Applicant Income
- Loan Amount
- Credit History
- Loan Amount by Income
- Property Area
- Education Status

These visualizations help to better understand the data and see which features are important for loan approval.

## Improvements
To enhance the loan approval system, the following improvements are suggested:

- **Larger Dataset**: Using a larger dataset with more comprehensive and diverse data points can improve the model's accuracy and robustness.
- **Additional Variables**: Including more variables such as ongoing loans, detailed credit scores, employment history, and other financial obligations can provide a more nuanced understanding of an applicant's creditworthiness.
- **Credit Score Gradations**: Implementing gradations in credit scores rather than binary good/bad credit history can help in making more precise predictions.
- **Model Enhancements**: Experimenting with different machine learning models and ensemble techniques could further improve prediction accuracy.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features based on domain knowledge can help in capturing hidden patterns in the data.
- **Real-time Data Integration**: Integrating real-time data sources for updating the model regularly can make the system more dynamic and relevant to current market conditions.
